  <h1 class="info">About Us</h1><br><br>
<p> We are girls powered by freedom.<br>
My name is Magwala Ongani. I am a Metallurgical engineer.<br>
After becoming unemployed due to Covid 19, I decided to follow my heart and do what my soul was meant to do on this earth.
I decided to establish this website to help young women get through all of the horrible issues we have to deal with as young women including our low self-esteem,
 low confidence, constant self-criticism and the need to be something we are not in order to feel accepted.
 I am in my twenties(and will remain there for the rest of my life, lol).
 And the reason I decided to start this “movement” is because I was young once and know the pain. 
 I dealt with all of the issues that young women deal with. I dealt with being bullied and teased at one time or another.
 My self-esteem as well as my confidence was shattered during different stages of my teenage life. 
 What I didn’t realize was how this was all going to affect me as an adult. How all of what happened to me as a teenager was going to haunt me in adulthood.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
 Over the last decade or so, I dove very deep into every type of self-help tool out there.
 And I learned so much in how to rebuild my self-esteem, my confidence and to be happy. 
 I am here now because I want to share all of what I learned with you.
 I will share exercises designed to figure out who you want to be, what your values are and how to get yourself into a place where you can finally know what it feels like to love yourself.
 I will suggest certain books to read and podcasts to listen to. 
 I will also be working on my own book written just for you and will be providing webinars and zoom calls so I can personally reach out to each of you to teach you all of the tools I learned to get you into a better place. 
 My promise to all of you is this. If you join me, you will get to that place where you can defeat all self-doubt.
 You will learn what direction you are meant to go in.
 And most importantly, you will learn to love yourself and once you are at that point, no one will be able to bring you down.
